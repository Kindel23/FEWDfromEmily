            <strong>In The Sea On The Whale </strong> - <em>Poem by Muzahidul Reza</em>
            In the sea on the whale
                The fishermen threw a pike, 
            The whale: I am harmless while
            You are hurting me deadly deep, 
                The fishermen: We wanna hurt you
                We need food, oil and other material
                Finding no more ways we gonna kill you
                Just now killings of you are very essential, 
            The whale: Who'll help you in lonely ocean? 
            Who will keep you safe from the hungry waves? 
                The fishermen: We've no answer of any question
                We will kill you for food, asset and hydrogen waves, 
            The whale: How dare you harm own killing on wild life? 
                The fishermen: We are wonder on how still you are alive.
